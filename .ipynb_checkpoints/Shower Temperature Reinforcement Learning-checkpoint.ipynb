    "# Reinforcement Learning to Regulate Shower Temperature\n",
    "One of the problems in my current apartment is that the shower temperature fluctuates frequently. Especially if someone flushes the toilet. In this project, I wanted to simulate the fluctuating shower environment and see if I could build a reinforcement learning model with TensorFlow in order to keep the temperature within the desired range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both supervised and reinforcement learning use mapping between input and output, reinforcement learning uses rewards and punishments as signals for positive and negative behavior. The goal in reinforcement learning is to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent."

    "The 5 important pieces that are needed in every reinforcment learning model are: environment, state, reward, policy, and value. The environment is the physical world within which the agent operates. The state is the current situation of the agent. The reward is feedback from the environment. The policy is a method to map the agent's state to actions. Value is the future reward that an agent would receive by taking an action in a particular state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the initializing actions consist of setting up an action space (which defines 5 actions that the RL model can take), an oberservation space (which defines the bounds of the shower temperature), the current state (defining the current temperature of the shower), and the shower_length (which defines how long each shower is).\n",
    "\n",
    "The RL model receives a positive reward when it keeps the shower temperature within the specified range (between 87 to 93 degrees fahrenheit) and a negative reward if it does not keep the shower temperature within the specified range. The policy of the model is that the shower's temperature changes by the RL model's action - 2. So if the model chooses action 4, then the temperature is increased by 4-2 = 2. If the model chooses action 2, then the temperature stays the same (2 - 2 = 0)."
